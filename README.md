# 🤖 Agentic AI Space  

Welcome to **Agentic AI Space** 🚀  
This repository gathers my projects around **Agentic AI**, exploring the creation of intelligent agents capable of reasoning, interacting, and learning autonomously.

## Projects  

### 1. 💬 Mobile App ChatBot  
**Problematic:**  
In many companies, admins or managers need to extract insights (number of users, sales history, invoices, etc.). Traditionally, this requires either a **data analyst** or manually browsing the database — a slow and repetitive process.  

This project provides an **AI-powered chatbot** using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, allowing admins to directly ask questions in natural language and instantly access key insights.  

**Keywords:** RAG · Conversational AI · Data Automation · Intelligent Agent · Admin Insights

### 2. 🖥️ Local LLM "Ollama"  
**Problematic:**  
If we receive **a large number of CVs**, should we analyze them manually? Of course not. The solution is to use a **local LLM with structured prompting** to act like a **data analyst**, automatically extracting and analyzing answers.  

**Keywords:** Local LLM · Ollama · Agentic AI · Document Analysis · Prompt Engineering

More projects will be added soon to enrich this space and dive deeper into the world of **autonomous and intelligent agents**.
